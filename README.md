# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regularization
Implementing the Regularization techniques and comparing before and after using it 


# Generate a complex synthetic dataset.
    1. Implement multiple linear regression on the dataset.
    2. Implement Ridge regression on the dataset.
    3. Compare the performance metrics of both models.
    4. Visualize the results.
    5. Explain the comparison.

# Step 1: Generate a Complex Synthetic Dataset

We'll create a dataset with multiple features and a non-linear relationship.

# Step 2: Implement Multiple Linear Regression on the Dataset
# Step 3: Implement Ridge Regression on the Dataset
# Step 4: Compare the Performance Metrics of Both Models
# Step 5: Visualize the Results
# Step 6: Explain the Comparison


# LASSO REGRESSION
  Comparison and Explanation
Mean Squared Error (MSE):

Multiple Linear Regression has a lower MSE (4.60) compared to Lasso Regression (6.84). This indicates that Multiple Linear Regression has a better fit to the data and lower prediction errors.
R-squared (R²):

Multiple Linear Regression has a higher R² value (0.779) compared to Lasso Regression (0.672). This suggests that Multiple Linear Regression explains more variance in the data compared to Lasso Regression.




# RIDGE REGRESSION
    Comparison and Explanation
Mean Squared Error (MSE):

Ridge Regression has a slightly lower MSE (4.51) compared to Multiple Linear Regression (4.60). This indicates that Ridge Regression has a marginally better fit to the data and slightly lower prediction errors.
R-squared (R²):

Both models have similar R² values, with Ridge Regression (0.783) being slightly higher than Multiple Linear Regression (0.779). This suggests that Ridge Regression explains a similar amount of variance in the data compared to Multiple Linear Regression.
