# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regularization
Implementing the Regularization techniques and comparing before and after using it 


# Generate a complex synthetic dataset.
    1. Implement multiple linear regression on the dataset.
    2. Implement Ridge regression on the dataset.
    3. Compare the performance metrics of both models.
    4. Visualize the results.
    5. Explain the comparison.

# Step 1: Generate a Complex Synthetic Dataset

We'll create a dataset with multiple features and a non-linear relationship.

# Step 2: Implement Multiple Linear Regression on the Dataset
# Step 3: Implement Ridge Regression on the Dataset
# Step 4: Compare the Performance Metrics of Both Models
# Step 5: Visualize the Results
# Step 6: Explain the Comparison
